# PrintHelper
## Description
* Visual Studio 2015 C# Universal App application that uses a helper printing method that supports async/await.

## Motivation
* Printing data can be a complex task.
* The printing API for Universal Apps is event-based and does not support async/await.
* This helper wraps the printing API so that it can be used to print collections of data (e.g. list of customers) in a simple way.
